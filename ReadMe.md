# Getting Started

The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Scripts Available

In the project directory, you can run the following commands: 

### `npm start`

Starts the app in the dev-mode. 
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

**Note:** The page reloads when you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the Interactive Watch Mode. 

See the section: [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more info

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It will bundls React in production mode and then optimize the build's performance

The build is made smaller and the filenames include the hashes.
Now the app can be deployed!

See the section: [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more info

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

you can `eject` at any time. This will remove the single build dependency

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies into the project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small/middle deployments.
